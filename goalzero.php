        <h3>Our Goal Zero Program</h3>
        <p>We’re as diligent about safety and compliance as you are. No job is so urgent that it cannot be done in a safe and responsible manner! We aim to protect ourselves, our fellow employees, and the environment from harm through our Goal ZERO Program.</p> <br>
        <p>To achieve this, we rely on the Hoover CS Safety Policy and its objective to implement a safe and hazard-free professional working environment through training, awareness, attitude development, and fostering a culture of participation and prudence. Turning these principles into practice has become a way for life for us, not because anyone has forced us to, but because we’ve embraced it as the right thing to do.</p> <br>
        <p>Additionally, we’re proud to partner with <strong>VelocityEHS</strong> to report near misses, incidents, and hazards. This is an important tool here at Hoover CS for reaching Goal ZERO.</p>
        <p>Read more about our safety programs &amp; policies in our <a class="whitegreen" href="/sustainability/">Sustainability Report</a>.</p>

            When I go to work, my main priority is to ensure I make it home in one piece, so I can continue to build and share memories with my wife &amp; children. That translates over to my colleagues as well. I want them to go home to their loved ones just the same as I do, which is why I work safely at Hoover CS.
