Currently serving as Hoover CS’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Kevin Friar is an established leader across the oil and gas, chemical, refining, and general industrial-end markets. Kevin joined Nalco Company LLC in 1990 and navigated several mergers and acquisitions over the years, eventually becoming Executive Vice President at Nalco Champion, An Ecolab Company, for the Oilfield Chemicals Division. After 27 wonderful years, Kevin made the decision in 2016 to retire and relocated his family to College Station, Texas. Shortly into retirement, Kevin was invited to lecture as a Professor for the Industrial Distribution Program for Texas A&M. Kevin taught undergrad and graduate courses from 2017 to 2018, and went on to establish several endowments to support, engage, and develop future Aggies. Those endowments include the Dr. F. Barry Lawrence Professor of Practice Endowment in Industrial Distribution, plus three separate endowments at the College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences: Dana & Kevin Friar Endowed DVM Scholarship; Dana & Kevin Friar Small Animal Hospital Endowment; and the Dana & Kevin Friar, Stevenson Companion Animal Life Care Center Endowment. Kevin currently sits on the Industry Advisory Board at Texas A&M Industrial Distribution. Gig ‘em! In 2019, Kevin came out of retirement to accept a role as CEO for Hoover CS. Shortly after, Kevin sold both the manufacturing and the Ferguson offshore segments, allowing the company to shift its focus and promote its large rental fleet of reusable IBCs and ISOs, along with integrated services and fleet management. Having successfully shifted the company’s focus to sustainability in 2021, Hoover CS aims to empower environmental responsibility through its sustainable packaging solutions. In his spare time, Kevin is an active member of his church’s College Ministry where he and his wife Dana mentor college students.
